# ping pong game
## using turtle and os library in python
classic two player ping pong game constructed in python language with the help of turtle library.

a two player game where the right side player uses the "up" and "down" keys to operate.
the left side player uses the "w" (upward) and "s" (downward) to move.

scores are updated when either side of the player misses to hit the ball back to the other player. 
idk maybe the game goes till infinity untill either of the players decide to stop. 

the turtle module helps in laying out the base of the video game
